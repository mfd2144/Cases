<p>I have created a recording system that can be easily implemented in the app and helps the user to get real time feedback even on the device.
  You can see the recorder screen at any time through dynamic objects. Other times, the user can turn it off and notice the new output as the button 
  changes its color. Also with clear button you can erase debug screen outputs. I also added network layer for decrease compile time . Also I gave
  answer to case 5 in view model file. </p>
  <p>Logger application can get output from two places. The first one is triggered by the print command in any layer or class of the program and is easily
  transmitted to the user by the top view controller. The other is by creating a struct that I call log and passing it to the embedded table view. </p>
  <p>You can find other cases answers in the Cases.playground file. If you have any question,  please contact me : m.f.dogan84@hotmail.com</p>
